# NSW COVID 19 STATS

A web scraper that scrapes the [NSW COVID 19 Stats Page](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/stats-nsw.aspx) and saves the data to a JSON

The intention is to output the data via a FastAPI

#### Next Steps
- Turn Scraper into a FastAPI
- Have FastAPI access Redis for values
- Have an updater that scrapes values and updates API in redis
- Deployment using poetry (?)
